      <p>My name is Javier was my Dad who chose my name, I born in Lima Peru and studied psychology, marketing and advertising in my born country, now I am studying to be a web developer in the boot camp of UCF. I have three favorities sports they are soccer, boxing and surfing. I love the beach and a perfect day its read, drink wine, and have a  good conversation in front of the ocean after a surfing day ...
        I knew about computers and coding once I was so young...in that time the computers what arrived to my country were comodore 64, apple and attari(not the console, the computer). and my dad bougth us the comodore 64...to play we need to put a cassette and wait a litle time to start, but also we have the option to coding our games and start to play with the coding and with the game once we finish the code... Yes in that time you buy a book who show you how to code your own game..., that was my first experience in coding and the last hahah. Then  live send me to other ways; but then because as live is like the earth "a circle" I am here again...</p>
